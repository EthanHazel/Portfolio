# What is this place?

This website is mainly here to document anything I work on. I've been making projects for myself and others for a while. I thought it was about time I showed the rest of the world what I'm up to (the world being the few people who are likely to visit).

I'll mainly be talking about the following things here.

- Web Design
- Graphic Design
- Web Development
- Programming
- Game Development

I probably could have combined some of those categories but then it wouldn't look as cool.

Now you may be thinking "Okay cool, but what the hell is the rest of this post even about though?". Honestly, I just thought about wanting to go through a few smaller subjects that wouldn't fit into a whole post.

So with that being said here's just some stuff I wanted to go over.

# The Tone Of This Blog

At first, I thought about making this place super sanitized and professional. I even went ahead and wrote a post in that style, and I hated it. I think if I had to write every post so that sounded like a board meeting, I would bore myself senseless.

I decided now that I was just going to be speaking my mind here. Almost like talking to a friend about what I've been up to.

Is this a good idea? Honestly, I'm not fully sure, this website is linked to my LinkedIn and other profiles. I feel like I would rather have fun explaining what I do though, not everything needs to be corporate sounding.

# Some Ideas For This Place

I think I might also talk more about general things that interest me too, not just my projects. Not everything here has to be business. I'm thinking about posting whatever comes to mind instead of running everything through a filter. I'm here to have fun essentially, hopefully, you do too.

I've also been thinking that maybe in the future, I could integrate a comment system. I think it would be cool to interact with people directly here, instead of just looking at basic viewer metrics.

# Little Monetization Of My Projects

I honestly hate the current state of monetization of online software. I get wanting to profit off of something that you've worked hard on, but it feels like it's been taken to an extreme recently. Even something as simple as a QR generator will have premium features with a subscription behind it.

I'm going to mainly focus on creating free and open-source products for the foreseeable future. I have a strong respect for open-source software. I would feel wrong pricing anything I make currently. I know that if I was the end user, I would probably ditch the software entirely.

# The End

That's all I had to talk about starting out. Hopefully, this post was at least somewhat informative for what I'm planning. If you have any suggestions or questions, feel free to contact me. The button is right up top.

Hopefully, this post is better than the amazing test posts I had live for a couple of days. If you have stuck around since then I proudly present you with this metal of loyalty üéñÔ∏è

**Hope to see you around again! üëã**
