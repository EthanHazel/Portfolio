The 6502 processor is an 8-bit microprocessor that was first released in 1975 by the MOS Technology company. It was originally designed by Chuck Peddle and Bill Mensch and was marketed as a lower-cost alternative to other processors available at the time.

The 6502 quickly gained popularity and was used in a variety of applications, including video games, home computers, and embedded systems. It is still popular today and is used in many retro computing projects.

The 6502 processor is known for its simplicity and low power consumption. It is an 8-bit processor, which means it can only handle 8-bit data at a time. It also has a relatively small instruction set, which makes it easy to program.

The 6502 processor has a number of features that make it popular among retro computing enthusiasts. It has a large number of I/O ports, which makes it easy to connect to external devices. It also has a built-in stack, which makes it easy to store and retrieve data.

The 6502 processor is also known for its performance. It has a clock speed of up to 1 MHz, which makes it fast enough to handle most retro computing tasks. It also has a relatively large address space, which makes it easy to store large amounts of data.

The 6502 processor is still popular today and is used in many retro computing projects. It is also used in many modern devices, such as smartphones and tablets. It is a testament to the power and flexibility of the 6502 processor that it has remained popular for so long.
